## PHP

- `HelloWorld.php` is the classical introductory exercise. Just returns "Hello, World!".

- `ReverseString.php` reverse a string.

- `ResistorColor.php` look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band to list the different band colors.

- `Hamming.php` calculates the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands. If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred. This is known as the "Hamming Distance".

- `Gigasecond.php` determine the date and time one gigasecond after a certain date. A gigasecond is one thousand million seconds. If you were born on `January 24th, 2015 at 22:00 (10:00:00pm)`, then you would be a gigasecond old on `October 2nd, 2046 at 23:46:40 (11:46:40pm)`.

- `Tournament.php` talls the results of a small football competition. The outcome should be ordered by points, descending. In case of a tie, teams are ordered alphabetically.

- `SimpleCipher.php` implements a simple shift cipher like Caesar and a more secure substitution cipher. The code allow us to specify a key and use that for the shift distance. This is called a substitution cipher. If someone doesn't submit a key at all, generates a truly random key of at least 100 alphanumeric characters in length.

- `HighScores.php` returns the list of scores, the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

- `Bob.php` Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

  - Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question, such as "How are you?".

  - He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you YELL AT HIM (in all capitals).

  - He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

  - He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

  - He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

- `RnaTranscription.php` given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

- `Luhn.php` given a number determines whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers.

- `Isogram.php` determine if a word or phrase is an isogram. An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.
